		<p>Welcome to Arvin's Web Site! </p> 
		<p>If the software, projects, and documents I maintain are valuable to you or have some errors, please <a href="mailto:arvin.sfj@gmail.com">email</a> me.</p>
		
		<h1>About this site</h1>
		<p>I use this site to record the software, open-source projects, technical documents and my life.</p>
		<p>If the HTML or graphics on this site seem to be confusing your browser, please <a href="mailto:arvin.sfj@gmail.com">email</a> me.</p>
		
		<h1>Projects</h1>
		<p>You can find all my <a href="https://github.com/arvinsfj">projects</a> in this site. I can use many programming languages and use them to develop these projects. If you don't understand those codes, please learn programming language first. </p>
		<p>And you can find all documents <a href="public/ctt/document.html">here</a>.</p>
		
		<h1>About me</h1>
		<p>You can read all about my projects, past present and future, including the software and FAQs I maintain.</p>
		<p>I'm not in the market for a job, though, unless you can offer a project that really fascinates me.</p>
		<p>You can read <a href="public/ctt/personal.html">personal stuff</a> about my life and politics and hobbies and friends. You may also find my <a href="public/ctt/blog.html">blogs</a> of interest.</p>
		
		<h1>Life, fun and skills.</h1>
		<p>Life is not only about live, but also you can solve problems and transcend wannable status.</p>
		<p>You have to get a basic thrill from solving problems, sharpening your skills, and exercising your intelligence.</p>
		<p>You must learn how to program.</p>
		
		<h1>Attitude.</h1>
		<p>The world is full of fascinating problems waiting to be solved.</p>
		<p>No problem should ever have to be solved twice.</p>
		<p>Boredom and drudgery are evil.</p>
		<p>Freedom is good.</p>
		<p>Attitude is no substitute for competence.</p>
