Welcome to Arvin's Web Site!

If the software, projects, and documents I maintain are valuable to you or have some errors, please [email](mailto:arvin.sfj@gmail.com) me.

### About this site

I use this site to record the software, open-source projects, technical documents and my life.

If the HTML or graphics on this site seem to be confusing your browser, please [email](mailto:arvin.sfj@gmail.com) me.

### Projects

You can find all my [projects](https://github.com/arvinsfj) in this site. I can use many programming languages and use them to develop these projects. If you don't understand those codes, please learn programming language first.

And you can find all documents [here](detail.html?doc=document.md).

### About me

You can read all about my projects, past present and future, including the software and FAQs I maintain.

I'm not in the market for a job, though, unless you can offer a project that really fascinates me.

You can read [personal](detail.html?doc=personal.md) stuff about my life and politics and hobbies and friends. You may also find my [blogs](detail.html?doc=blog.md) of interest.

### Life, fun and skills.

Life is not only about live, but also you can solve problems and transcend wannable status.

You have to get a basic thrill from solving problems, sharpening your skills, and exercising your intelligence.

You must learn how to program.

### Attitude.

The world is full of fascinating problems waiting to be solved.

No problem should ever have to be solved twice.

Boredom and drudgery are evil.

Freedom is good.

Attitude is no substitute for competence.
